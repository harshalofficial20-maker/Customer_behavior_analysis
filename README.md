# Customer_behavior_analysis
Data Analytics Project using Python, SQL and Power BI
📊 Data Analyst Project – End-to-End Analytics Pipeline
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, exploration, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using industry-standard tools such as Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, and Power BI, and present results in a clear, business-ready format.

📁 Dataset

Source: CSV file (Customer / Sales / Shopping Behavior dataset)

Format: .csv

Description:
The dataset contains customer-level transactional and demographic information used to analyze patterns, trends, and key performance metrics.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

PostgreSQL

SQL

Power BI

Gamma (for PPT creation)

Excel (optional for validation)
